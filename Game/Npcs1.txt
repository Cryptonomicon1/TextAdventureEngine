Hi, how are you?

thief in closet
What? Maybe I need to leave. I don't feel safe with a thief hiding in the closet here.

family?
I am a wife with two kids and a brother. They are a handful. I wish my husband did more around that house though. I am sure you know all about that, haha.

job?
I do the accounting for Preston. He is an inspiring stock broker.

hobbies?
I don't have much time for hobbies. I work hard, then I work hard some more. Between Preston, my kids, and my husband. I don't have much time left in the day.

dreams?
I dream of making just enough money to retire. I work hard now to relax later. You?
