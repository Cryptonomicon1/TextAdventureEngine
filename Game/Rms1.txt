Grand Hall
A massive chandelier adorns the ceiling. One spiral staircase stands on the right when you enter the front door. The floors are marble. The tall drapes span 6 meters from ceiling to floor.

Owner's Bedroom
The bedroom has a king sized bed with Egyptian cotton sheets. There is a huge window on the wall. The walk-in closet is open. There are mahogany nightstands on either side of the bed.

Study
The marble bookcases reach the ceiling.

Closet
Clothes line the walls. Shoes fill the floor. Don't step on any!

Outside
It is cold. You want to go back inside to the warm house with the warm men.
